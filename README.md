## Daily Note Format

### Filename

```
YYYY MMDD.md  →  e.g. 2026 0115.md, 2025 0208.md
```

### Task line format

```markdown
- [x] 0115-0140 Event title
- [ ] 900-1700 Another event #work
- [x] 2030-2115 Study session @personal
    - Sub-point becomes event description
    - Another detail line
```

**Time format:** 3–4 digit compact (`0115` = 01:15 · `900` = 09:00 · `1700` = 17:00), interpreted as 24-hour time.

## Calendar Tagging (Optional)

| Mode | How it works |
|---|---|
| No explicit tags | All time-blocked tasks are exported |
| `#tags` | Extracts `#work`, `#personal`, `#cal/study` etc. from task lines |
| `@labels` | Extracts `@work`, `@personal` etc. from task lines |

After scanning, a tag configuration table appears — you can rename each tag's calendar name and choose which ones to include. Events with no selected tag are excluded when tagging is active.
